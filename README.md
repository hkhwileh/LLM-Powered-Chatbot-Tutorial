# LLM-Powered Chatbot Tutorial ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬

This repository provides an example of building a **language model-powered chatbot** that can hold conversations and remember past interactions. It's perfect for learning how to use LLMs for chat-based applications, and serves as a foundation for more advanced use cases, such as:

- **Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enable chatbots to reference external data.
- **Agent-based Systems:** Create bots that can perform specific actions.

### Features
- **Dynamic Conversation**: Implements a chatbot capable of responding to user inputs using the Groq language model.
- **Message History**: Demonstrates how to store and retrieve chat history for context-aware interactions.
- **Stateful Design**: Shows how to maintain conversation state using a `ChatMessageHistory` class.
- **Integration**: Uses the LangChain library and Groq API for enhanced chatbot capabilities.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Groq API Key**: Obtain your API key from [Groq](https://groq.com).
- **Dependencies**: Install required libraries such as `langchain`, `dotenv`, and `langchain_groq`.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your environment:
   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Add your Groq API key to a `.env` file.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the chatbot implementation and see it in action.

### Code Highlights
- **Basic Chatbot Implementation**: 
  - Uses `ChatGroq` for model invocation.
  - Processes user inputs dynamically with placeholders for personalization.
- **Message History**:
  - Tracks and stores conversation history to enable stateful interactions.
  - Demonstrates reusable patterns for session management.

### Future Enhancements
- Expand with **Conversational RAG** for document-based queries.
- Integrate additional tools to handle user requests dynamically.
- Deploy as a REST service or integrate into an existing web application.
